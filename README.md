# git-bisect-little-trick-demo
This repository demonstrates the use of the git bisect command to locate a bug in a codebase. Using a simple Python script (calculate.py) that introduces an intentional bug, this demo walks through each step of git bisect, helping users understand how to efficiently find the exact commit where a bug was introduced.
